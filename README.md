# Cruchy vs Smooth V2

A simple [Solana](https://solana.com/) program to vote for your favorite type of peanut butter. Built with [Anchor](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/introduction.html) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

This is a follow up to a previous [walkthrough](https://www.brianfriel.xyz/learning-how-to-build-on-solana/) in which I covered the basics of how to write a program on Solana. In this follow up, I refactor my application to make use of [Program Derived Addresses](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses).

Check out the [live version](https://www.pbvote.com/) of this app. Blog post TBA.
